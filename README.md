# Install Solace Message Router HA deployment onto a Google Kubernetes Engine (gke), cluster

## Purpose of this repository

This repository expands on [Solace Kubernetes Quickstart](https://github.com/SolaceProducts/solace-kubernetes-quickstart) to provide a concrete example of how to deploy redundant Solace VMRs in HA configuration on Google Kubernetes Engine on a 3 node GKE cluster across 3 zones.  If you are looking for a simple way to install a single Solace message router into GCP, please see [Solace GCP Quickstart](https://github.com/SolaceLabs/solace-gcp-quickstart).

## Description of Solace VMR

Solace Virtual Message Router (VMR) software provides enterprise-grade messaging capabilities so you can easily enable event-driven communications between applications, IoT devices, microservices and mobile devices across hybrid cloud and multi cloud environments. The Solace VMR supports open APIs and standard protocols including AMQP 1.0, JMS, MQTT, REST and WebSocket, along with all message exchange patterns including publish/subscribe, request/reply, fan-in/fan-out, queueing, streaming and more. The Solace VMR can be deployed in all popular public cloud, private cloud and on-prem environments, and offers both feature parity and interoperability with Solace’s proven hardware appliances and Messaging as a Service offering called Solace Cloud.

## How to Deploy a VMR onto GKE

This is a 5 step process:

[//]:# (Section 1 prereq is direct copy from here:  https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/quickstart)

**Step 1**: Create a project in Google Cloud Platform and enable prerequisites:

* In the Cloud Platform Console, go to the Manage resources page and select or create a new project.

    [GO TO THE MANAGE RESOURCES PAGE](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/projects)

* Enable billing for your project. Follow the guide from the below link.

    [ENABLE BILLING](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6293499#enable-billing)

* Enable the Container Registry API.  Follow the below link and select the project you created from above.

    [ENABLE THE API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=containerregistry.googleapis.com)


<br>
<br>

**Step 2**: Use the button below to go to the Solace Developer portal and request a Solace Evaluation edition VMR. This process will return an email with a Download link. In the email do a right click "Copy Hyperlink" on the "Download the VMR Evaluation Edition for Docker" hyperlink. This link is of the form "http<nolink>://em.solace.com/" and will be needed in the following section.

Note: The Evaluation edition VMR is required to support HA deployment.

<a href="http://dev.solace.com/downloads/download-vmr-evaluation-edition-docker" target="_blank">
    <img src="/images/register.png"/>
</a>

**Step 3**: Place Solace VMR in Google Container Registry:

* Open a Google Cloud Shell from the Cloud Platform Console used to create the project, like this:

![alt text](/images/launch_google_cloud_shell.png "Google Cloud Shell")

<br>
<br>

* In the Cloud Shell paste the following, (replace http<nolink>://em.solace.com/ with the link received in email from step 2.)

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SolaceProducts/solace-gke-quickstart/master/scripts/copy_vmr_to_gkr.sh
chmod 755 copy_vmr_to_gkr.sh
./copy_vmr_to_gkr.sh -u http://em.solace.com/
```

<br>

* The script will end with a link required for Step 5.  You can view the new entry on the google container registry in the Cloud Platform Console:

![alt text](/images/google_container_registry.png "Google Container Registry")

<br>
<br>

**Step 4**: Use Google Cloud Shell to create GKE cluster of three nodes.

* Download and execute the cluster create script in the Google Cloud Shell. All argument defaults would be ok if you want a single non-HA VMR. Specify `-n = 3` as number of nodes per zone and a single `-z <zone>` for an HA Cluster in a single GCP zone. If you want the VMR cluster spread across 3 zones within a region (recommended for production), then specify the 3 zones as per the example below but leave the number of nodes per zone at default 1:

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SolaceProducts/solace-gke-quickstart/master/scripts/create_cluster.sh
chmod 755 create_cluster.sh
./create_cluster.sh -z us-central1-b,us-central1-c,us-central1-f
```

This will create a GKE cluster of 3 nodes spread across 3 zones:

![alt text](/images/Nodes_across_zones.png "Google Container Engine nodes")

Here are some more GKE `create_cluster.sh` arguments:
* The default cluster name is "solace-vmr-cluster", which can be changed by specifying the `-c <cluster name>` command line argument.
* The default machine type is "n1-standard-4". To use a different [Google machine type](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types ), specify `-m <machine type>`. Note that the minimum CPU and memory requirements must be satisfied for the targeted VMR size, see the next step.

<br>

You can check that the Kubernetes deployment on GKE is healthy with the following command, which should return a single line with svc/kubernetes:

```sh
kubectl get services
```
If this fails, you will need to [troubleshoot GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/support ).

Also note that during install of GKE and release Solace HA, several GCP resources such as GCE nodes, Disks, and Loadbalancers are created.  After deleting a Kubernetes release you should validate that all resources created are deleted.  The [Solace Kubernetes Quickstart](https://github.com/SolaceProducts/solace-kubernetes-quickstart(https://github.com/SolaceProducts/solace-kubernetes-quickstart/tree/master#deleting-a-deployment) ) describes how to delete a _release_. If it is necessary to delete the GKE _cluster_ refer to the [Google Cloud Platform documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/delete ).

<br>
<br>

**Step 5**: Use Google Cloud Shell to deploy Pod and Service to that cluster.  This will finish with a Solace VMR HA configuration deployed to GKE.

* Download and execute the cluster create and deployment script in the Google Cloud Shell.  Replace `<YourAdminPassword>` with the desired password for the management `admin` user. Replace `<releaseTag>` with the release tag of the image in the container registry.

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SolaceProducts/solace-kubernetes-quickstart/master/scripts/start_vmr.sh
chmod 755 start_vmr.sh
./start_vmr.sh -p <YourAdminPassword> -i gcr.io/${DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID}/solos-vmr:<releaseTag> -v values-examples/small-persist-ha-provisionPvc.yaml
```

#### Using other VMR deployment configurations

In current configuration above script has created and started a small-size HA VMR deployment with a provisioned PersistentVolume (PV) storage.

For other deployment configuration options refer to the [Solace Kubernetes Quickstart README](https://github.com/SolaceProducts/solace-kubernetes-quickstart/tree/master#using-other-vmr-deployment-configurations ).

### Validate the Deployment

Now you can validate your deployment in the Google Cloud Shell:

```sh
prompt:~$ kubectl get statefulsets,services,pods,pvc,pv

Note here several IPs and port. In this example 104.154.54.154 is the external Public IP to use. This can also be seen from the google cloud console:

### Viewing bringup logs

It is possible to watch the VMR come up via logs in the Google Cloud Platform log stack.  Inside Logging look for GKE Container, solace-vmr-cluster.  In the example below the Solace admin password was not set, therefore the container would not come up and exited.

## Gaining admin and ssh access to the VMR

The external management IP will be the Public IP associated with your GCE instance. Access will go through the load balancer service as described in the introduction and will always point to the active VMR. The default port is 22 for CLI and 8080 for SEMP/SolAdmin.

See the [Solace Kubernetes Quickstart README](https://github.com/SolaceProducts/solace-kubernetes-quickstart/tree/master#gaining-admin-access-to-the-vmr ) for more details including admin and ssh access to the individual VMRs.

## Testing Data access to the VMR

To test data traffic though the newly created VMR instance, visit the Solace developer portal and select your preferred programming language to [send and receive messages](http://dev.solace.com/get-started/send-receive-messages/ ). Under each language there is a Publish/Subscribe tutorial that will help you get started.

Note: the Host will be the Public IP. It may be necessary to [open up external access to a port](https://github.com/SolaceProducts/solace-kubernetes-quickstart/tree/master#upgradingmodifying-the-vmr-cluster) used by the particular messaging API if it is not already exposed.
